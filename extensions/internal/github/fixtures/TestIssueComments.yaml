      has trouble with repository directories that contain characters that are either
      special to Go''s `%q` string encoding or special to sqlite. Some characters
      cause `askgit` to exit with \"unrecognized token\" trying to create the virtual
      table, while others make it further and fail (or produce no data) when executing
      SQL statements.\r\n\r\nSome special characters do not render well on github,
      so I''ve included equivalent shell commands for making these directories.\r\n\r\nThe
      following directories behave the same. `select count(*) from commits` returns
      no results (not the number 0 - it returns an empty resultset), while `select
      count(*) from files` panics with \"panic: invalid handle\":\r\n* `back\\slash`
      (`mkdir ''back\\slash''`)\r\n* `thing﷐` (`mkdir ''thing''$''\\357\\267\\220''`)\r\n*
      `new\r\nline` (`mkdir ''new''$''\\n''''line''`)\r\n* `doublequotes\");--injection`
      (`mkdir ''doublequotes\");--injection''`)\r\n\r\nThe following directories all
      fail without running the SQL query, with an error like `unrecognized token:
      \"\");\"`:\r\n* `quotation\"marks` (`mkdir ''quotation\"marks''`)\r\n* `comma\",separated\"`
      (`mkdir ''comma\",separated\"''`)\r\n\r\nThis seems to be caused by building
      a SQL string using `fmt.Sprintf` and `%q`, which quotes/escapes strings in a
      way that Go understands rather than in a way that sqlite understands.\r\nGo
      will format `\"` in the middle of a string as `\\\"`, which Sqlite considers
      to be a literal backslash character followed by the end of a string, which is
      why most directories with the double quote character result in \"unrecognized
      token\".\r\nFor other characters it seems like Go will escape them (e.g. `\\`
      becomes `\\\\`, newline becomes `\\n`), and Sqlite happily passes the escaped
      versions to the modules'' `Create` functions, which presumably try and fail
      to open a directory named e.g. `back\\\\slash` instead of `back\\slash`\r\n\r\nThis
      can be reproduced in the tests by changing the fixture repo from `\"repo\"`
      to e.g. `\"repo\\\\\"` or `\"repo\\\"\"`","closed":true,"closedAt":"2020-09-02T02:51:45Z","comments":{"totalCount":5},"createdAt":"2020-08-22T01:34:47Z","createdViaEmail":false,"databaseId":683902299,"editor":null,"includesCreatedEdit":false,"isReadByViewer":true,"labels":{"totalCount":0},"lastEditedAt":null,"locked":false,"milestone":null,"number":41,"participants":{"totalCount":4},"publishedAt":"2020-08-22T01:34:47Z","reactions":{"totalCount":0},"state":"CLOSED","title":"Issues
